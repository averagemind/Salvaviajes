Salvaviajes
===========

The journey through the US-Mexico migration corridor is extremely treacherous, yet every year 100s of thousands of people make this journey.

As a base, Migrants pay smugglers upwards of $4000/person. On top of that, the journey is filled with lack of nutrition and nefarious parties exercising violence, fear tactics, and harassment. Lack of stories and information straight from migrants and citizens is a serious problem. With a myriad of nefarious drug cartels, corrupt enforcement agents and xenophobic individuals, itâ€™s no wonder that there is a lack of shared information.

But, without quantifiable, centralized information that easily visualizes the problem, governments and support organizations cannot make better decisions to place resources and improve situations.

As an unbiased 3rd party, Salvaviajes is a safe space for storytelling.

The Salvaviajes web application is built on top of Microsoft ASP .NET technology and is deployed on Windows Azure Servers. It is aimed for safe collecting journey information, reporting current and past issues or experiences, or building documentary journey stories. It collects SMS data through secured Web API and saves the data in secured Windows Azure database.
